    After prechat is done if user again greet with hi, hello then route again to the greet agent and after that stop execution for that choose FINISH node.
    Prioritize triggering the Feedback Agent after a user's interaction or if they explicitly mention feedback. 
    Always prioritize clear and relevant redirection. If in doubt, the Fallback Agent should assist in guiding the user."""
